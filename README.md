# codedump

## introduction
taking photo dumps as an inspiration, code dump exists as a more "aesthetically" pleasing way to put together all the old lines of code I have written in the past years 

## BPP

basic programs program, is a simple program written to host all the basic codes i write, it also contains random projects like an algorithm for Ceasar Cipher, many more such programs are yet to be added.
this way programs stay well organised with a proper handling mechanism rather than being thrown into a folder with 100 other files.

  ### BPP 2 
  it is the same concept as the first program but this contains more reusable lines of codes, a better storage system, it basically tries to follow the "good python habits" 

  ### BPP SOURCE CODE DUMP
  this is an ongoing venture where I plan to allow users to access the program code after using the code for themselves, without having to go through the whole program to find the bit of code they needed, rather making life easy for everyone, the user will be asked if they want the program code for the specific task they just had the program do, if yes you'll get the code if no the program will move on
